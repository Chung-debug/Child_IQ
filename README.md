# 🧠 Child IQ Analysis 

## 📊 Does a Mother's Education Influence Her Child's Intelligence?

This project explores whether a child's IQ is influenced by their mother's level of education. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we dive deep into visualizations, correlations, and insights that reveal the true nature of this relationship.

## 🚀 Project Overview

* **Goal**: Investigate if a child's intelligence (IQ) correlates with their mother's education level.
* **Dataset**: Contains IQ scores of children and details about their mothers' education levels.
* **Tools Used**: `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`.

## 🔍 Key Insights

* **Univariate and Multivariate Analysis**: Detailed visual breakdowns of variables affecting child IQ.
* **Correlation Matrix**: Weak correlations suggest little to no influence between education level and child's IQ.
* **Outlier Observation**: One of the highest-scoring children has a mother with only high school education, challenging genetic assumptions.

## 📌 Conclusion

> Intelligence is not solely inherited. Environmental and personal factors may play a much larger role than parental education levels alone.

This notebook encourages deeper conversations about educational equity, parenting, and the non-linear path of human development.
